/*
 * Changelog
 * 
 * 2013-02-17: Initial version
 * 2013-02-18: introduced abstract base class so that simulations can have virtual
 * 		spaces of different dimensionalities, layouts, etc. (ram)
 * 2013-02-27: Moved into gridworld package. (ram)
 * 2013-03-07: Made abstract, since the render() method will be client specific. (ram)
 * 	    Added EntityManager parameter so that clients can render items if they like. (ram)
 * 2013-04-10: Gave CompassBearing the ability to map back and forth from degrees (ram)
 * 2017-01-20: 	Added comments to methods for better understanding (asel)
 * 2017-02-03:	Added a getter method for the angle since it's required by the GUI to show move buttons in their corresponding directions
